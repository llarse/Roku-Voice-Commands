# Voice Controller for Roku

Part of my programmed on my day off collection.





## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages

Then you need to make a .env file with your roku ip in it. Like this

.env
```
ROKUIP=XXX.XXX.X.XXX
```

By default, it will report to the console any words it picks up. To turn this off, go to the config.json file and change "Verbose" from true to false

## Usage

Run the main.py script and use ctrl+c to cancel
## Future Improvements

I plan to implement my own NLP AI into this or at least a more secure/offline voice analyzer
